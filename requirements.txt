# Requirements lower bounds listed here are our best effort to keep them up to

# you find any incorrect lower bounds, let us know or propose a fix.

# NOTE(harlowja): Because oslo.serialization is used by the client libraries,
# we do not want to add a lot of dependencies to it. If you find that
# adding a new feature to oslo.serialization means adding a new dependency,
# that is a likely indicator that the feature belongs somewhere else.
